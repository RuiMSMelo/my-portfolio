      <h1>I design & build digital experiences</h1>
      <p>
        Hey, I'm Rui Ser√¥dio Melo, a web developer with a profound connection to
        the ocean.
        <br />
        <br />
        Originally from Portugal and now living in Madrid, I bring my love for
        the digital world with a background rooted in marine biology and several
        years of diving experience.
        <br />
        <br />
        Fluent in Portuguese, English, and Spanish.
        {/*, I bring a multilingual touch to my work.*/}
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        This portfolio is where I showcase my projects and continuously improve
        them.
        <br />
        In the future, I'll also feature projects I'm currently working on. It's
        a space that evolves with my journey, reflecting my commitment to
        progress in web development.
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        Let's create together!
